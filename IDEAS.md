# FIRE Calculator - Ideas & Future Enhancements

## Core Insight
The single most important factor is the **savings rate**. With high savings rate (50-90%), FI is achievable irrespective of income level.

## Formula Solver
Given any 3 of these variables, solve for the 4th:
- `x` = savings rate (% of income saved)
- `r` = real return rate (investment return - inflation)
- `N` = FI number multiplier (25x for 4% rule, 40x for 2.5% rule)
- `t` = time to FI

## Potential Calculations

### 1. Sensitivity Analysis
- How does ±1% change in return rate affect time to FI?
- How does ±5% change in savings rate affect time to FI?
- Monte Carlo simulation with variable returns

### 2. Coast FIRE Calculation
- Given current portfolio, what age will it grow to FI target with no additional contributions?
- "How much do I need NOW to coast to FI by age X?"

### 3. Sequence of Returns Risk
- Early retirement is vulnerable to market crashes in first few years
- Visualize different withdrawal scenarios with historical data

### 4. Savings Rate vs Time to FI Graph
- Classic visualization showing the exponential relationship
- Shows FI possible in 10-15 years at 50%+ savings rate

### 5. Income vs Expenses Paths
- Show growing investment portfolio vs. stable expense needs
- Visualize the "crossover point"

### 6. Tax Optimization
- Traditional vs Roth conversions
- Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies (ladder, etc.)

### 7. Geographic Arbitrage
- Same portfolio, different locations with different costs
- LeanFIRE in LCOL vs FatFIRE in HCOL

### 8. Partial FIRE / Barista FIRE
- How much part-time income reduces portfolio withdrawal needs
- "If I make $X/year part-time, how much less do I need saved?"

## Implementation Priority
1. Simple compound interest calculator (IN PROGRESS)
2. Core FIRE formula solver
3. Visualizations for key insights
4. Additional scenarios as needed
